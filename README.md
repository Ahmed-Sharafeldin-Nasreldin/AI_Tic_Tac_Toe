Tic-Tac-Toe Player
Introduction
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI player. The AI player is designed to make optimal moves using the minimax algorithm, ensuring a challenging game for the user.

Files
tictactoe.py: Contains the implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, including functions for player turns, actions, result of moves, winner determination, game termination, utility evaluation, and the minimax algorithm.

runner.py: Provides a graphical interface for playing against the AI. Run this file to play the game interactively.
